# AISearchAlgorithms
It has searching algorithms which can be used in game theory to reach the goal state from initial state
A* search algorithm is used to solve many problems like finding path in maze with obstacles,to search an node in tree etc.
This algorithm is unique compared to other searching techniques because it uses a heuristic to predict the next move every step.
Iterative deeping search combines space efficiency of DFS and time efficiency of BFS to search a node in tree.
